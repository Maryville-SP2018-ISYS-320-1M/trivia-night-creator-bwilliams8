First stage: Solo Questions
- Consider whether all 10 questions should be based around a central topic, or more diverse
- Brainstorm 10 questions which would be tough, but not impossible for the average participant
- Input the questions into PowerPoint slides, starting from the easiest being slide 1 and the hardest being slide 10 (subjective)
- Seek an external opinion as to whether the questions are suitable (optional, but would improve question quality)

Second stage: Development Preparation / Group Questions
- Gather 10 other members' presentations packed with questions
- TWO OPTIONS:
- Format them each in a similar way, and make program read directly from PowerPoint files
- Transcribe PowerPoint slides into text files for safety & consistency's sake

Third stage: Java
- Read data from PowerPoint / text files
- Randomly pick a set of 10 questions (should pick one text file or one PowerPoint presentation)
- Possibly assign points to each of the questions in ascending order (since 10 should be the hardest, have points ramp up in each set of 10)
